## What is Forex?

**Forex** (Foreign Exchange) is the global marketplace where currencies are traded. It's the largest financial market in the world with over $7.5 trillion traded daily.

### Key Points:
- **24/5 Market**: Open Monday to Friday, 24 hours
- **Currency Pairs**: You trade one currency against another (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY)
- **Decentralized**: No central exchange, trades happen globally
- **High Liquidity**: Easy to buy and sell

### Simple Example:
If you think the Euro will get stronger against the US Dollar, you buy EUR/USD. If Euro goes up, you make money. If it goes down, you lose money.

## How Forex Works

### Currency Pairs Explained:

- **Exchange Rate**: How much quote currency needed for 1 base currency

### Example:
EUR/USD = 1.0500 means:
- 1 Euro = 1.05 US Dollars
- If rate goes to 1.0600, Euro got stronger
- If rate goes to 1.0400, Euro got weaker

### Major Currency Pairs:
- **EUR/USD** (Euro/US Dollar) - Most traded
- **GBP/USD** (British Pound/US Dollar)
- **USD/JPY** (US Dollar/Japanese Yen)
- **USD/CHF** (US Dollar/Swiss Franc)
- **AUD/USD** (Australian Dollar/US Dollar)
- **USD/CAD** (US Dollar/Canadian Dollar)
- **NZD/USD** (New Zealand Dollar/US Dollar)

## Trading Strategies

### 1. Trend Following
**Concept**: "The trend is your friend"
- Identify trend direction
- Buy in uptrend, sell in downtrend
- Use moving averages to confirm trend

```
Uptrend Example:

Price
   |     ✦
1.08|   ✦   ✦        Higher Highs
   |  ✦     ✦
1.07| ✦       ✦     ╱ Trend Line
   |✦         ✦   ╱
1.06|           ✦╱      Higher Lows
   |          ╱✦
1.05|        ╱   
   |      ╱     Entry points along trend
1.04|    ╱       
   |  ╱         
1.03|╱___________________________> Time
```

**Example Setup:**
- Price above 50 EMA = Uptrend
- Wait for pullback to EMA
- Buy when price bounces up
- Stop loss below recent low

### 2. Range Trading
**Concept**: Trade between support and resistance
- Identify price range
- Buy at support, sell at resistance
- Works in sideways markets

```
Range Trading:

Price
   |
1.07| ═══════════════════════ Resistance (SELL here)
   |   ✦       ✦       ✦
1.06|  ╱ ╲     ╱ ╲     ╱ ╲
   | ╱   ╲   ╱   ╲   ╱   ╲
1.05|╱     ╲ ╱     ╲ ╱     ╲
   |       ✦       ✦       ✦
1.04| ─────────────────────── Support (BUY here)
   |
1.03|_________________________________> Time

Buy at support, sell at resistance
Stop loss outside the range
```

### 3. Breakout Trading
**Concept**: Trade when price breaks key levels
- Find strong support/resistance
- Wait for price to break through
- Enter trade in breakout direction
- High risk, high reward

### 4. Scalping
**Concept**: Very short-term trades (minutes)
- Make small profits quickly
- Requires tight spreads
- High stress, requires focus
- Not for beginners

### 5. Swing Trading
**Concept**: Hold trades for days/weeks
- Less screen time needed
- Catch bigger price moves
- Good for part-time traders

---

## Risk Management

### Golden Rules:

#### 1. Never Risk More Than 2% Per Trade
- If account = $1000
- Maximum risk = $20 per trade
- This protects your capital

#### 2. Use Stop Losses Always
- **Stop Loss**: Automatic order to close losing trade
- **Example**: Buy EUR/USD at 1.0500, stop loss at 1.0450
- **Maximum loss**: 50 pips

#### 3. Risk-Reward Ratio
- **Minimum 1:2 ratio**
- **Risk**: $20 to make $40
- **Risk**: 25 pips to make 50 pips

#### 4. Position Sizing Formula:
```
Position Size = (Account Balance × Risk %) ÷ (Stop Loss in Pips × Pip Value)
```

**Example:**
- Account: $1000
- Risk: 2% ($20)
- Stop Loss: 50 pips
- Pip Value: $1 (for standard lot)
- Position Size: $20 ÷ (50 × $1) = $20 ÷ $50 = 0.4 lots

### 5. Don't Overtrade
- **Quality over quantity**
- Wait for good setups
- Don't trade when emotional
- Take breaks after losses
